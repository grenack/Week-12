                       Internet has five requirement to work withwhich are to work which are the name and locations, the Domain Name System, packets and routers,TCP and
  IP, and HTTP of the machine. To find the name and location of the machine, the first thing has to do is to establish a network 
  connection of browser. For that to happen, you have to know the network location of the host, which is the IP address. Your browser 
  queries aprogram called a name server that live on your machine. The Dain Name System is the program and databases that cooperates to 
  translate hostname to IP addresses. A domain is collection of machines that share a common name suffix. They defined by an authoritative 
  name server. They only have to know the location of the name server to work. Inside of a packet there are three important things which 
  are source address, the destination address, and service number or port number. With these a browser can send a command to the Web 
  server. The router is the one will ship the packet down the wire until it get to the machine. Internet uses two protocols for multiple-
  packet transmissions which are IP and TCP.  IP(Internet Protocol)  is in lower level that responsible for exchanging information over a 
  network. TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) is in Upper level that support reliability. Both of TCP/IP contains a checksum to enable 
  detection of date corrupted by bad link. The final step is the application protocol that runs on top of TCP/IP using to pass strings of  
bytes back and forth known as HTTP. Bound everything in one Internet will work .
